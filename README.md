SpotBot Platform Implementation Plan

Building a comprehensive bot detection and reporting platform similar to AbuseIPDB but specialized for bots.
Core Features to Implement:

    Project structure and technology stack setup
    Database schema for bot tracking and reporting
    REST API for bot reporting and checking
    Bot detection algorithms and pattern recognition
    User authentication and authorization system
    Web frontend for SpotBot SaaS interface
    API rate limiting and security measures
    Trend analysis and reporting features
    Network-based bot identification
    Auto-halting/blocking functionality
    Documentation and deployment configuration

Technology Stack:

    Backend: Laravel
    Database: PostgreSQL for relational data + Redis for caching
    Frontend: React.js with modern UI framework
    API: RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
    Authentication: JWT-based auth
    Monitoring: Basic logging and metrics
    Build user bot confidence score system
    Collect and aggregate bot network, bot individuals, troll networks, bad actors in general eventually
    Bad actors could be account churners, report polluters, associated with bad mac address or ip
    
Implementation Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

    Set up Laravel
    - Configure PostgreSQL database schema
    - Implement basic API endpoints
    - Add an authentication system
    Create basic frontend structure
    - react or alpine for now
    - react native eventually
    Create a shareable user bot detection system, and box it into a container so it is easily shared. 
    - This would be in whatever language does this best, go, java, python, etc.

Implementation Phase 2: Browser extension

    for firefox and google build extentions that when users right click or search a user and plaform combo they get our confidence score of wther or not something is a bot
